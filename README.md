# Scalable Silex Boilerplate App

Out of the box, Silex is very powerful, but it doesn't leave you with much in the way of setting up a scalable architecture.

This is a boilerplate Silex app that does that using controllers, routes, models, and config files - the way you would expect to see it in a framework like Symfony.

To use:
- install apache, php, composer
- clone the repository
- set a symlink from the repository to the public apache folder
```bash
sudo ln -s ~/path/to/Scalable-Silex-Boilerplate /var/www/
```
